# Toy SQLite implementation in Rust

Implemented a toy database following the [Let's Build a Simple Database][0] tutorial to understand the database internals.

# TODOs:
Have the implementation as close to [SQLite][1] as possible.
The current implementation has a very rudimentary parser and a B+Tree implementation for backend storage.

- [ ] Improve REPL
- [ ] Refactor Command Processor
- [ ] ...
